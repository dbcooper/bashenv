**tl;dr**: another collection of personalized dotfiles

I use and develop on CentOS/RHEL, Fedora, Ubuntu/Debian--mostly
headless--and sometimes Windows computers.  This is a collection of
configurations and cross-platform-y installation script(s) so it's
quick and painless for me to setup a comfortable, consistent
environment.

Ubuntu/Debian(?) Preparation
----------------------------

Install the following packages:

    apt install git curl vim neovim ack-grep powerline tmux

Post-Install
------------

Run vim and/or nvim and type the following:

    :PlugInstall
